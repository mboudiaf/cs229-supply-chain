# Optimizing a hydrogen and power Supply Chain

The   electrification   of   the   economy,   required   by increasing  environmental  concerns,  seems  to  be  harder  to  put in   place   in   some   sectors   than   others. 
Hydrogen   could   help further  decarbornize  such  sectors,  in  which  electrification  is technically   impossible   or   not   viable  
from   a   business   stand-point. This requires the implementation of a reliable and robust hydrogen supply chain. The objective of this 
project is to analyze how  a  hydrogen  supply  chain  could  optimally  be  integrated  inthe existing power network, that is how it could
take maximum advantage  of  the  existing  electricity  facilities  while  ensuring  the provision  of  hydrogen  to  the  market.
 Reinforcement  Learning  and  MILP  algorithms  were  ran  on similar  case  studies  to  understand  which  approach  gives  the optimal 
 policy  to  implement  in  the  hydrogen  and  power  supply chains. While MILP allows to model the physics of the problem more 
 intuitively,  the  Reinforcement  Learning  approach  was  the only  method  that  captured  the  time-related  dynamics  of  the system.

## Structure 

The code for both the RL approach and the MILP one is available in code/ . For more instructions, go this section. If you want to know more
